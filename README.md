# php-graph-learning

A simple PHP and Javascript code that dynamically read some url's, parses them and draw some charts based on parsed information.

Uses [SimpleHtmlDom](http://simplehtmldom.sourceforge.net) for parsing and [FusionCharts](http://www.fusioncharts.com) for drawing charts.

Tested on Google Chrome version 52 and Firefox version 39
